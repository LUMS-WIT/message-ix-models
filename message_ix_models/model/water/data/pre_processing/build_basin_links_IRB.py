"""Build ``data/water/network/basin_links_IRB.csv`` from real Indus basin data.

This is a one-off, standalone conversion script -- not part of the
importable :mod:`message_ix_models` package, run manually whenever the
source data changes. It documents exactly where the real inter-basin
network data (river routing, canals, transmission lines) that
:mod:`message_ix_models.model.water.data.network` consumes actually came
from, and how it was converted -- so the conversion is reproducible and
auditable, per this repo's own data-handling conventions (``doc/data.rst``:
"if message_ix_models relies on certain adjustments to the data, do not
commit the adjusted data [alone] -- commit code that performs the
adjustments").

Source data
-----------
Originally from the team's SharePoint ("NEST Indus/data_phase_1/Abdul
Moiz's Data" and other synced copies of the same `indus_model/input`
folder), now committed in this repo under ``data/water/network/raw/``
(small: shapefile + CSVs together are under 2.5 MB, well within a normal
git object -- no Git LFS needed)::

    data/water/network/raw/
        Indus_bcu.shp / .dbf / .shx / .prj  -- master basin shapefile:
                                                PID, DOWN (downstream
                                                basin), REGION, outlet
                                                coordinates. All 24 basins.
                                                Only .dbf (the attribute
                                                table) is read by this
                                                script; .shp/.shx/.prj are
                                                kept alongside so the file
                                                is a complete, usable
                                                shapefile for anyone who
                                                wants the geometry too.
        indus_bcu_canals.csv                -- real named canals: PID_i,
                                                PID_o, capacity_m3_per_sec,
                                                length_km.
        PID_distances_km.csv                -- real basin-to-basin
                                                distances.
        basin_transmission/
            existing_routes.csv             -- real electricity
                                                transmission routes + 2015
                                                capacity (MW).

(Committed rather than fetched or left local-only, per this project's "no
external data fetching" convention and an explicit decision to keep this
raw source in-repo for reproducibility.)

These are the exact files the legacy R+GAMS indus_ix model
(``NEST/MESSAGEix/basin_msggdx_load_inputs.r``) reads to build its own
per-arc technologies -- this script is the Python-side equivalent
conversion, targeting :mod:`network`'s CSV schema instead of one
hand-written GAMS technology block per link type.

The PID -> BCU_name crosswalk
------------------------------
The source files name basins ``AFG_1``, ``AFG_2``, ``CHN_1..3``,
``IND_1..6``, ``PAK_1..13`` -- not the ``1|AFGHAN_SOUTH``, ``12|PAKISTAN``
naming already used by ``basins_by_region_simpl_IRB.csv`` (the delineation
this project's Python model already relies on). No spatial geometry is
available for the *existing* Python-side delineation to verify a match
directly (its source shapefile lives on a private IIASA network drive, see
``hydro_agg_spatial.R``), so the crosswalk below is an **inferred, ordinal
mapping** -- PID numeric suffix order within each country, in the same
per-country order as the existing BASIN_ID sequence -- not a
spatially-verified one.

Evidence for the mapping (checked before use, not assumed):

- Basin count matches exactly: 24 in both schemes.
- Per-country split matches exactly: AFG 2 / CHN 3 / IND 6 / PAK 13, both
  sides.
- The single "india_east"-tagged basin lands at the identical relative
  position in both schemes: ``IND_4`` is the 4th of 6 India entries in the
  source data; ``9|INDIA_EAST`` is the 4th of the six India rows
  (6, 7, 8, **9**, 10, 11) in ``basins_by_region_simpl_IRB.csv``.

If this is ever confirmed wrong (e.g. by finally getting the original
delineation shapefile), only ``CROSSWALK`` below needs correcting --
everything downstream of it is generic.

Usage
-----
Run this script directly -- no editing needed, source data is committed
in-repo. It overwrites ``data/water/network/basin_links_IRB.csv`` in
place::
