"""Prepare data for ``irr_<method>_<crop>`` technologies -- the third and
final layer of the crop/rainfed/irrigation port of the legacy R+GAMS
indus_ix model's crop submodel
(``NEST/MESSAGEix/basin_msggdx_technologies.r``, ~line 12802-13012). This is
the layer that actually gives the model real, basin-level irrigation water
(and electricity) demand -- the whole point of this migration (see
``data/demands.py``'s now-bypassed, GLOBIOM-linked ``add_irrigation_demand``
for what this replaces on the IRB/country build path).

Data model
----------
One technology per (irrigation method, crop) pair -- 7 real methods
(``irr_flood``, ``irr_drip``, ``irr_sprinkler``, ``irr_canal_lining_flood``,
``irr_smart``, ``irr_drip_smart``, ``irr_sprinkler_smart``) x 9 crops, named
``<method>_<crop>``. Present only in basins with real, positive
``irrigation_yield`` AND real crop-water-requirement data for that crop --
the intersection, matching the R model's own node filter.

Consumes, per unit of activity (1 Mha of land put under this irrigation
method for this crop):

- ``<crop>_land`` (the shared land pool from :mod:`.land`), level ``crop``.
- **Surface water withdrawal**, scaled from the real annual crop water
  requirement by ``1 / (water_efficiency * field_efficiency_conv)`` --
  ``water_efficiency`` is real, per-method data (``irr_tech_data_IRB.csv``,
  0.40 for flood up to 0.95 for smart drip); ``field_efficiency_conv``
  (0.4675) is the fixed field/conveyance-loss constant from
  ``config.yaml``. Reuses the existing **basin-tier**
  ``surfacewater_basin`` / ``water_avail_basin`` commodity (matches
  :mod:`.network`), *not* the region-tier ``freshwater``/``water_supply``
  pair the old simplified ``irrigation_cereal`` etc. use -- see the
  crop/irrigation migration plan's naming-reconciliation section.
- **Electricity**, proportional to the withdrawal rate via the method's
  real ``electricity_intensity`` (kWh/m3, converted to GWa/MCM). Reuses
  the existing ``electr`` / ``final`` commodity (the only electricity
  commodity in the repo). Omitted entirely for methods with zero
  electricity intensity (gravity-fed flood/canal-lining methods).

Produces:

- The generic ``crop_land`` commodity (level ``area``), same shared pool
  :mod:`.rainfed` produces.
- ``<crop>_yield`` (level ``crop_yield``), simplified to an annual rate
  (see :mod:`.rainfed`'s docstring for the same simplification there).
- **Irrigation losses -> groundwater recharge**: the portion of withdrawn
  water not actually consumed by the crop
  (``withdrawal * (1/(water_efficiency*field_efficiency_conv) - 1)``)
  feeds the **existing** ``groundwater_basin`` / ``water_avail_basin``
  commodity, which the existing ``gw_recharge`` technology already
  consumes (``water_supply.py``, ``demands.py``) -- no new commodity
  needed.

Only ``irr_flood_<crop>`` gets a historical-capacity bound from real 2015
irrigated-land data (``crop_irr_land_2015``) -- matches the R model's own
``grepl('irr_flood_', ...)`` rule (``historical_capacity`` flag in
``config.yaml``), since that's the only method with real pre-2015 land
data broken out. All 7 methods can compete for *new* investment, though
-- see "Vintaging" below for why this isn't the fidelity gap it first
appeared to be.

Deliberate simplifications relative to the R model
----------------------------------------------------
- **Electricity-flexibility output dropped.** The R model gives "smart"
  irrigation methods a secondary output to a ``flexibility``/
  ``energy_secondary`` commodity (demand-response service value). Nothing
  in this model produces or consumes a matching commodity -- same
  "unbacked orphan commodity" reasoning as dropping machinery energy in
  :mod:`.land`.
- **No SW/GW source split.** The real
  ``historical_irrigation_withdrawals_IRB.csv`` records separate
  ``irrigation_sw_diversion``/``irrigation_gw_diversion`` historical
  activity, implying the R model has a *further* technology layer
  splitting irrigation by water source that isn't part of the
  ``crop_<crop>``/``rainfed_<crop>``/``irr_<method>_<crop>`` block this
  port targets (out of scope to trace through the 13,000+ line source
  file). This port draws only from ``surfacewater_basin``; the historical
  floor below (sw+gw combined) is treated as a single combined target on
  that one commodity -- a documented simplification, not a hidden gap.
- **Real vs. computed water year.** The real crop-water-requirement data
  (``crop_irrigation_water_IRB.csv``) is decadal
  (2010/2020/.../2060); each model year's ``year_act`` is matched to the
  *nearest* available data year rather than interpolated.

Demand-pull: the historical-withdrawal floor
----------------------------------------------
Nothing upstream of this layer (no food demand, see :mod:`.land`'s module
docstring) forces any of this to actually run -- resolved with the user by
adding a **relation** per basin (``hist_irr_withdrawal_<basin>``) with
``relation_lower`` set to the real, annualized historical sw+gw diversion
total for that basin (``historical_irrigation_withdrawals_IRB.csv``), and
``relation_activity`` coefficients equal to each technology's own real
withdrawal rate -- i.e. "the sum of water actually withdrawn by every
irrigation technology active in this basin must be at least the observed
historical baseline." This is what makes this layer's addition to a real
scenario solve produce a genuine, nonzero effect instead of the same
zero-effect result the network module's `river`/`canal_conv` links had
(nothing there required them to be used; here, something does).

The floor is not always fully reachable, and the model must be solved
accordingly. Checked directly against the real committed scenario data
(summing each basin's real historical capacity x its relation coefficient
against that basin's floor): **all 16 real Pakistan/India/Afghan basins
with a relation fall 10-25% short** of their floor using only
``irr_flood_<crop>``'s real historical capacity -- because
``historical_irrigation_withdrawals_IRB.csv``'s total reflects *every*
irrigation method historically used at that basin, not just flood (the
only method this port ever gives real capacity, per its own
``historical_capacity`` convention -- see "Multi-vintage..." below for
why). This was invisible before the phantom-vintage fix (below): free
phantom capacity could paper over any shortfall. Resolved with the user:
**the floor is soft, not hard.** Any real solve of a scenario carrying
this relation must enable message_ix's native
``SLACK_RELATION_BOUND_LO`` mechanism (disabled by default) via
``scenario.solve(..., gams_args=['--SLACK_RELATION_BOUND_LO=""'])`` --
without it, the real scenario is genuinely infeasible. With it,
``RELATION_CONSTRAINT_LO`` becomes ``REL + SLACK_RELATION_BOUND_LO >=
relation_lower`` (model_core.gms), and the model reports any unavoidable
shortfall via the ``SLACK_RELATION_BOUND_LO`` variable rather than
refusing to solve -- penalized at a large, fixed 1e6/unit in the
objective (a message_ix-wide constant, not a parameter this port
controls), so the model still strongly prefers real capacity wherever
available.

Vintaging -- three designs tried, in order, before landing on the one
that actually works
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting this right took three attempts, each a real bug found and fixed,
not a style preference:

1. **Single long-lived historical vintage** (one real ``year_vtg <
   firstyear``, ``life_exp`` up to 100y spanning the whole horizon).
   Real ``historical_new_capacity`` works here (a genuine pre-model
   vintage), but GAMS's own data-completeness check
   (``data_load.gms``'s "Technical lifetime not defined" abort) requires
   ``technical_lifetime`` at *every* model-horizon year the technology
   is merely *active* in, not only its construction year -- confirmed:
   narrowing this aborts the real solve. Those extra years then become
   legitimate ``CAP_NEW`` vintages with no real ``input``/``output`` row
   of their own -- "phantom" capacity, free to build, drawing no real
   resource. A ``relation_lower``-forced technology exploited exactly
   this: real-scenario ACT showed activity at a ``year_vtg`` its own
   ``input`` table had no row for. Found via a commodity-balance sanity
   check (``irr_flood_<crop>`` activity vs. matching ``crop_<crop>``
   output): **all** 144 "nonzero activity" rows from an earlier
   checkpoint were mismatched -- activity with no real land behind it.
2. **Explicitly blocking the phantom loophole**
   (``bound_new_capacity_up = 0`` on the extra years) reproduced a
   *third* bug, confirmed independently via ~25 hand-built minimal GAMS
   scenarios: a technology with more than one valid vintage active in
   the same year, forced by ``relation_activity``/``relation_lower`` or
   ``bound_activity_lo``, breaks ``RELATION_EQUIVALENCE``'s presolve in
   this GAMS/CPLEX build ("... infeasible, all entries at implied
   bounds") -- confirmed to happen *even when* the second vintage is
   hard-capped to zero capacity, not only when it's a free "new-build"
   option. A follow-up (prohibitive ``inv_cost`` instead of a hard
   bound) avoided the infeasibility but still let CPLEX fund a small
   amount of phantom capacity regardless of cost -- confirming this
   isn't a rational tradeoff GAMS is making, but a presolve/formulation
   artifact of the ``SUM(vintage$(map_tec_lifetime(...)))`` construct
   whenever more than one distinct ``year_vtg`` exists for a
   relation-forced technology.
3. **same_year_only everywhere, re-seeding the same real value every
   period.** Sidestepped #2's phantom-vintage problem entirely (every
   active year is its own independent vintage; no second one ever
   exists to create a loophole) -- but rested on a wrong premise.
   ``historical_new_capacity`` registered at a model-horizon
   ``year_vtg`` is *silently ignored* by GAMS: confirmed directly
   against ``model_core.gms``, ``CAPACITY_MAINTENANCE_HIST`` -- the
   only equation that reads ``historical_new_capacity`` -- is gated on
   ``historical(vintage)``, true only for a genuine pre-model year.
   Every model-horizon vintage instead gets its capacity *solely* from
   ``CAP_NEW`` via ``CAPACITY_MAINTENANCE_NEW``. The "144 nonzero
   activity" result this design produced was real, but came entirely
   from unconstrained new investment, not from the real 2015 land data
   believed at the time. Tried adding ``bound_new_capacity_up = 0``
   here too (to block that investment) and confirmed it makes capacity
   **zero, always** -- with no ``historical_new_capacity`` contribution
   possible at a model-horizon vintage, blocking ``CAP_NEW`` leaves
   nothing else to supply capacity at all.

**The actual fix**: the full, natural, *unrestricted*
``get_vintage_and_active_years()`` result for every method -- exactly
the pattern any ordinary message_ix investment technology uses, not
filtered to one vintage and not forced ``same_year_only``. Every
model-horizon year gets a legitimate "build new here" vintage candidate
with its own real, matching ``input``/``output``/cost data (not just
``technical_lifetime``, which is what made attempt #1's phantom
vintages exploitable) -- so any new capacity GAMS chooses to build is
genuine and cost-real, never free, and there is no artificial second,
data-less vintage for ``RELATION_EQUIVALENCE`` to trip over.
``historical_new_capacity`` is registered only at the one real pre-model
seed year (``irr_flood`` only, the only method with real pre-2015
irrigated-land data), where it actually applies.

**Real, accepted tradeoff, decided with the user**: new investment
beyond the real 2015 baseline remains possible at any method wherever
the real cost data favors it -- this was tested and found to happen for
real (basins investing hundreds of millions to billions of USD to close
the gap to their historical-withdrawal floor, rather than pay the
relation's soft-bound slack penalty). Structurally forbidding this
(``bound_new_capacity_up = 0`` everywhere) was tried and rejected: it
made capacity zero *everywhere* (see #3 above), which is worse than
allowing economically-justified new investment. This also *removes* an
earlier fidelity gap noted in this module: since new capacity genuinely
*can* be built from a zero base given a strong enough incentive
(contrary to an earlier, incompletely-tested claim to the contrary), all
7 irrigation methods can now compete for real activity here, not only
``irr_flood`` -- closer to the R model's own apparent intent.

Land/irrigation capacity under this design no longer represents a fresh
annual choice (the R model's ``lft = 1``) or a single fixed 2015 seed
the model only ever draws down -- it is a real historical baseline that
the model can extend via genuine new investment where the economics
justify it. That is a real fidelity choice, made deliberately and
knowingly, not a hidden side effect.
